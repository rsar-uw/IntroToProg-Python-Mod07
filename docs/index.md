## Summary
Similar to preceding assignments, I thought this week’s assignment was a significant step up in complexity and challenge. Despite the program functionality being stripped down from the prior assignment, I can confirm the feeling “60% of code is exception handling”. At least, for me, it sure felt that way. Unforeseen (and highly-irregular) opportunities over this past weekend may have also effectively compressed my available time for this assignment. I think the code structures and frameworks that were provided as part of prior assignments were helpful. One challenging (and personally, frustrating) aspect of this assignment was the reliance on self-research to learn the level of coding needed to adapt prior assignments’ code. I will surely appreciate the “assignment answers” example for this module’s lessons for future reference.
